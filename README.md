# Onfido Capture SDK for Android: Example app

This is repository contains sample code for an Android application intended to showcase how the [Onfido Android SDK](https://github.com/onfido/onfido-android-sdk) should be used.

In order to use the API (and the SDK) you'll need an Onfido account and an API token that you can get from the settings screen.
